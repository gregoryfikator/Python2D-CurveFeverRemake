# Python2D-CurveFeverRemake

This project is a very basic remake of famouse Curve Fever game with PyGame library. 

## Technologies and major libraries:

- Python 3.9.1
- pygame 2.0.1

## Alpha version features:

- Made as a `2 players - 1 keyboard game` where winner is choosen in best of 5 series of rounds (win 3 rounds to win series).
- 4 different collectible speed modifiers generated randomly on the board (speed up me, speed up enemy, slow down me, slow down enemy).
- Collision detection with borders of board, self drawn lines, enemy drawn lines and collectibles.

## Launching:

Personally, I launch the game in Visual Studio Code with installed extension for Python by choosing Run -> Start debugging/Run without debugging.
However the game should also start by simply executing command `py main.py` in root directory
